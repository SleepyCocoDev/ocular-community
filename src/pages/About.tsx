                Ocular is a versatile, Roads-based guild in Albion Online. Above all, we are a family and a community that extends beyond the game itself. Our primary goal is simple: to have fun. This philosophy defines our guild ethosâ€”we play Albion to unwind, escape real life, and enjoy memorable moments with our gaming family.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed italic">
                If you're not having fun, then why are you playing? We measure our success by the amount of fun per hour.
